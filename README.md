# trigrams

**Author**: Megan Flood and Han Bao
**Version**: 1.0.0


## Overview
Trigram analysis is very simple. Look at each set of three adjacent words in a document. Use the first two words of the set as a key, and remember the fact that the third word followed that key. Once youâ€™ve finished, you know the list of individual words that can follow each two word sequence in the document.

The trigram function takes two argument:
1. relative path to the file
2. number of words you wish to return


## Getting Started
Can be run directly from the trigrams.py file.

OR

``` python trigrams.py some_book.txt 500 > my_submission.txt```


## Architecture
Written in Python, used pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-watch modules testing.
Use setup to created the package.


## Change Log
